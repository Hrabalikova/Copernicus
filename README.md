# Copernicus Monitoring Service Workshop Series

This repository contains code, scripts, and resources for hands-on sessions covering **Land**, **Marine**, and **Atmosphere** monitoring using data and services from Copernicus.

## Overview

This workshop series is designed to be beginner-friendly, with a focus on practical applications of Copernicus data. Each session includes morning presentations followed by afternoon coding and demo sessions. Participants will get hands-on experience using pre-prepared scripts and notebooks, which they can adapt for their own needs.

### Workshop Topics

1. **Land Monitoring Service**
   - Morning: Overview of Copernicus Land Monitoring Services and user cases 
   - Afternoon: Hands-on session using adjusted scripts from the EEA repository to explore land monitoring datasets and workflows.
   
2. **Marine Monitoring Service** (to be added)
   - Morning: Overview of Copernicus Marine Monitoring Services
   - Afternoon: Hands-on session exploring marine datasets.

3. **Atmosphere Monitoring Service** (to be added)
   - Morning: Overview of Copernicus Atmosphere Monitoring Services
   - Afternoon: Hands-on session exploring atmospheric datasets and tools for air quality assessment.

    cd copernicus-workshops
    ```

2. Install required dependencies (if any):
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

3. Launch Jupyter Notebook:

## Workshop: Land Monitoring Service

### Description

In this session, we will use pre-adjusted scripts derived from the **EEA Land Monitoring Repository**, with additional functionality that weâ€™ve added to enhance the workflows. Participants will learn to about ARLINE data, snow and ice monitoring, and assess data using various Copernicus Land Monitoring datasets.

### Structure

- `land/land_monitoring.ipynb`: Main notebook for the hands-on session.
- `data/`: Contains example datasets for land cover analysis.
- `docs/`: Contains additional reading and references.

### How to Run the Notebook

1. Open `land/land_monitoring.ipynb` in Jupyter Notebook.
2. Follow the instructions within the notebook to explore the land monitoring workflows.
